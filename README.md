### **CLASS SUMMARY**

The Topic of the class was about the 3 basics of a computer, which are mainly stated as the 
- `Control`
- `Arthimetic` 
- `Memory unit` 
 
 Which was expressed symbololically by the title of the class named as the following 
 - `Text` 
 - `Calculator` 
 - `Storage` 
 > note the the highlighted texts are presented respectively 
 
 1)Text is a form of input given for a pc in a physical form and gives instuction for a pc to perform a certain task, this mainly happens through programming languages which are instruction given for the machine to excute, the main thing to focus on here is that programming languages have a similar common property despite their usage their similarity is given in their body, which include the CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) and their difference is given by their opening and closing and other functions like excuting a code.
 
 For example 
 ```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
> In the above the above code we can see that the there is a format written before the opening and closing body,the body part is known to be the main part or the CSS part as discussed in the last class

2)Calculator is the part of the computer that process the data inserted to the computer, in the manhathen project American physicist was given a group of data to work on for the atomic experiment and due to the large amount of data given to him he was helped by a group of Brilliant Female Math expert`s which were given a bunch of equation broken up into their simplest terms which inturn creates a high amount of numbers that can be calculated easliy
